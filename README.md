# homeworks

This repository mostly stores my homework solutions for courses I took during my MS program (2012\~2015) at Natioanl Taiwan University and PhD program (2015\~now) at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
The correctness of the solutions is definitely not guaranteed.
If you find errors or know improvements over the solutions, please feel free to raise an issue.
Thanks!
