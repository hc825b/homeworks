% Extension: using program analyzer + bounded model checking

The number of unwindings is perhaps the most important factor in our
recursive analysis technique (Table~\ref{table:experiments}). We find
that \textsc{CPAchecker} performs poorly when many unwindings are
needed. We however do not enable the more efficient block encoding in
\textsc{CPAchecker} for the ease of implementation. One can improve
the performance of our algorithm with the efficient but complicated
block encoding. A bounded analyzer may also speed up the
verification of bounded properties. 

Our algorithm extracts function summaries from inductive invariants. 
There are certainly many heuristics to optimize the computation of
function summaries. For instance, some program analyzers return error
traces when properties fail. In particular, a valuation of formal
parameters is obtained when \textmd{CheckSummary}
(Algorithm~\ref{algorithm:check-summary}) returns $\FF$. If the
valuation is not possible in the $\fun{main}$ function, one can use
its inductive invariant to refine function summaries. We in 
fact exploit error traces computed by \textsc{CPAchecker} in the
implementation.
