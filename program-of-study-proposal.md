Required Courses
================

- [CS 421] Progrmg Languages & Compilers
- [CS 477] Formal Software Devel Methods
- [CS 427] Software Engineering I

Reasons
-------

Since my primary research interest falls in PL/FM/SE group,I'd like to take the
3 fundamental courses covering the PL, FM, and SE fields.


Elective Courses
================

PL/FM/SE
--------
- [CS 476] Program Verification
- [CS 527] Topics in Software Engineering
- [CS 522] Programming Language Semantics
- [CS 591 FM] Advanced Seminar - Formal Methods Seminar
- [CS 591 SE] Advanced Seminar - Software Engineering Seminar
- [CS 598] Special Topics

Reasons
~~~~~~~

These are some advanced courses and seminars provided by PL/FM/SE group.
I suppose these courses could provide a sense of doing research in these fields. 


Theory
------

- [CS 498 MP3] Special Topics - Logic
- [MATH 461] Probability Theory
- [CS 574] Randomized Algorithms

Reasons
~~~~~~~

These courses provides mathematical foundations for techniques largely used in
PL/FM/SE fields.


Embedded Systems
----------------

- [CS 431] Embedded Systems
- [CS 584] Embedded System Verification

Reasons
~~~~~~~

Most safety critical systems are embedded systems, and they require much
strict safety guarantee.
I think it's a good direction to survey for research topics and applications,
so I want to learn backgrounds in this field.
